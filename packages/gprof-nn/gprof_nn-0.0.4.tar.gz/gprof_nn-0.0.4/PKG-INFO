Description: # GPROF-NN
        
        This Python package implements the GPROF-NN retrieval algorithms for the passive
        microwave observations of GPM.
        
        ## Overview
        
        This package provides a command line application, which implements the principal data preparation,
        training and retrieval functionality of the retrieval. In addition to that, the ``gprof_nn`` python
        package provides utility functions for the processing of GPM-related data.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be install using pip.
        
        Because the package is still under development it is recommended to install it  from source.
