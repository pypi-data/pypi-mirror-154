# ChiakiLisp, LISP syntax over Python && C++

## Qt5 Demo

![alt Qt 5 Demo App](demos/qt5-demo-app.png)

## Demo Source

1. [AST Evaluate Mode (Python3 API)](examples/ast-mode/qt5-simple-app-window.cl)
2. [Code Generation' Mode (C++ API)](examples/cxx-mode/qt5-simple-app-window.cl)

## Other Demos

### There examples support ast-mode/cxx-mode

1. [Recursively Calculated Factorial](examples/factorial.cl)
2. [A short example for a Functional Programming Style](./examples/funcional.cl)

## Description

[ChiakiLisp](https://chiakilisp.jedi2light.moe) - yet another LISP syntax for the Python 3 && C++

There are few similar projects already exist:
 - [HyLang](https://hylang.org) - pretty cool project, compiles LISP into Python 3 bytecode, cool
 - [NanamiLang](https://nanamilang.jedi2light.moe) - my attempt to mix Clojure-like look-and-feel and Python 3 core

But this project tries to be as simple as possible, but providing some features like:
 - Custom formatting for Python 3 native data types
 - Multiline lambda functions (unreachable in Python 3 syntax)
 - `if` special form which looks more like Python 3 ternary expression
 - `when` special form which is basically `if` but with `nil` for `else`
 - `let` blocks with their own local environment unreachable from outer scope
 - `nil/true/false` keywords (you do not need the press a Shift key any time you want to type them)
 - `->/->>` aka `first/last threadin macro` right in Python 3, could you imagine this earlier, guys?)
 - Obviously, you do not need to separate your operands by a coma (,) (also, `{}` form does not need colon (:) char)

## Simple and complex (collections) data types

ChiakiLisp does not use custom wrappers for any of them:
 - When you type `nil`, you get `NoneType` data type
 - When you type `1234`, you get `int` data type
 - When you type `"hello, world"`, you get `str` data type
 - When you type `true` or `false`, you get `bool` data type
 - When you type `[...]`, you get `list` data type
 - When you type `{...}`, you get `dict` data type
