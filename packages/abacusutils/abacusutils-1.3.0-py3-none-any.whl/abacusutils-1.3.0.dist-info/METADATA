[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/abacusutils/badge/?version=latest)](https://abacusutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/abacusutils)](https://pypi.org/project/abacusutils/) [![Tests](https://github.com/abacusorg/abacusutils/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abacusorg/abacusutils/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

abacusutils is a package for reading and manipulating data products from the Abacus *N*-body project.
In particular, these utilities are intended for use with the [AbacusSummit](https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io)
suite of simulations.  We provide multiple interfaces: primarily Python 3, but also C/C++ [coming soon!] and
language-agnostic interfaces like Unix pipes.

These interfaces are documented here: <https://abacusutils.readthedocs.io>

Press the GitHub "Watch" button in the top right and select "Custom->Releases" to be notified about bug fixes
and new features!  This package is still in early stages, and bugs are likely to be identified and squashed,
and new performance opportunities identified.

## Installation
The Python abacusutils package is hosted on PyPI and can be installed
by installing "abacusutils":
```
pip install abacusutils
```

The Unix pipe interface (`pipe_asdf`) is also installed as part of the pip install.
Note that our custom ASDF fork is no longer required as of abacusutils 1.0.0.

The C/C++ code (coming soon!) can be downloaded directly by cloning
this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/abacusorg/abacusutils.git
```
or by downloading a zip archive of the repository:
```
wget https://github.com/abacusorg/abacusutils/archive/master.zip
```

## Usage
abacusutils has multiple interfaces, summarized here and at <https://abacusutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>.

Specific examples of how to use abacusutils to work with AbacusSummit data will soon
be given at the AbacusSummit website: <https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io>

### Python
The abacusutils PyPI package contains a Python package called `abacusnbody`.
This is the name to import (not `abacusutils`, which is just the name of the PyPI package).
For example, to import the `compaso_halo_catalog` module, use
```python
import abacusnbody.data.compaso_halo_catalog
```

### Unix Pipes
The ``pipe_asdf`` Python script reads columns from ASDF files and pipes them to
``stdout``.  For example:

```bash
    $ pipe_asdf halo_info_000.asdf -f N -f x_com | ./client
```
