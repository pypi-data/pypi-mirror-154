# HTTP Import
HTTPIm is a basic library to import files via HTTP.<br>
**Is not a good idea to use in real projects where you need fast script**.

# Installation
```
pip install httpIm
```

# Use
After installing, here's a brief tutorial.

```py
import http_import

arguing = http_import.import_library('https://github.com/ZSendokame/arguing/blob/main/arguing/argument.py')
# Will import argument.py, now you can use it as arguing.
# example: arguing.get() (a real function in argument.py).
# Also, there's a pseudo-cache.

arguing = http_import.import_library('https://github.com/ZSendokame/arguing/blob/main/arguing/argument.py', cache=bool)
# Cache by default is True.
# If cache is true, if the file is already installed it will directly import it, no requests.
# If cache is false, it will do the request even if the file is already installed.
```
