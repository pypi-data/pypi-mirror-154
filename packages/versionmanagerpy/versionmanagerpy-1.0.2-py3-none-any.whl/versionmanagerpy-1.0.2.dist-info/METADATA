# versionmanager.py
A GitHub Project Version Manager that polls latest version data from GitHub repo release tag.

# Installation
### PIP
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/versionmanagerpy/)

`> pip install versionmanagerpy`

# Usage
versionmanager checks the version passed to its constructor against the tag attached to the latest release on a GitHub repo. Comparing the given version string against the `tag_name` value at [https://api.github.com/repos/{author}/{projectName}/releases/latest](). This means release tag names need to be formatted specifically for this. Versionmanager doesnt support letters in version categories* and assumes a separator of a period unless told otherwise.

*A version category is a set of numbers separated by a uniform character (e.g. 2.0.3 has categories 2, 0, and 3). Using Semantic Versioning there are usually 3 version categories (major, minor, and patch) but versionmanager supports more categories as well. 
```
import versionmanagerpy

def main():
	vm = VersionManager("Aquatic-Labs", "Umbra-Mod-Menu", "2.0.4")
	
	vm.on_outdated += lambda: print("Outdated.")
	vm.on_current += lambda: print("Current.")
	vm.on_dev += lambda: print("Dev.")
	
	vm.check_status()

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()

```
