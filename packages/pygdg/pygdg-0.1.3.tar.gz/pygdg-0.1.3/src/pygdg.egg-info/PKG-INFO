- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Daily game connection number
- Average game connection duration
- Daily game session number
- Retention D1/D2/D3/D4/D5/6/D7/D14/D28
- Average game session duration
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily User)
- ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)

## We want to track the following player state

- Level
- Win/Lost session
- # of friend asks
- # of friends
- # of chat message
- # of leader boards views
- # of items bought
- Spend in â‚¬
- life time value
