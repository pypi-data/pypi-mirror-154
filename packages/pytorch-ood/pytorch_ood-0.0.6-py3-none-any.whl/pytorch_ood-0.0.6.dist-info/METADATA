Python library to accelerate research in Out-of-Distribution Detection, as well as related
fields such as Open-Set Recognition, Novelty Detection, Confidence Estimation and Anomaly Detection
based on Deep Neural Networks (with PyTorch).

This library provides

- Objective Functions
- OOD Detection Methods
- Datasets used in academic literature
- Neural Network Architectures used in academic literature, as well as pretrained weights
- Useful Utilities

and was created with the aim to speed up research and to facilitate reproducibility.
It is designed such that it should integrate seamlessly with frameworks that enable the scaling of model training,
like [pytorch-lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/).


## Installation

```shell
pip install pytorch-ood
```

### Required Dependencies

* `torch`
* `torchvision`
* `scipy`
* `torchmetrics`


### Optional Dependencies

* `libmr` for OpenMax Detector
* `pandas` for the Cub200 Dataset

For OpenMax, you will have to install `libmr`, which is currently broken.
You will have to install `cython` and `libmr` afterwards manually.


## Quick Start
Load model pre-trained with energy regularization, and predict on some dataset `data_loader` using
Energy-based outlier scores.

```python
from pytorch_ood.model import WideResNet
from pytorch_ood import NegativeEnergy
from pytorch_ood.utils import OODMetrics

# create Neural Network
model = WideResNet(pretrained="er-cifar10-tune").eval().cuda()

# create detector
detector = NegativeEnergy(model)

# evaluate
metrics = OODMetrics()

for x, y in data_loader:
    metrics.update(detector(x.cuda()), y)

print(metrics.compute())
```

- [ ] add more datasets, e.g. for audio and video
- [ ] implement additional tests
- [ ] migrate to [DataPipes](https://github.com/pytorch/data)

## Contributing
We encourage everyone to contribute to this project by adding implementations of OOD Detection methods, datasets etc,
or check the existing implementations for bugs.

## License
The code is licensed under Apache 2.0. We have taken care to make sure any third party code included or adapted has compatible (permissive) licenses such as MIT, BSD, etc.
The legal implications of using pre-trained models in commercial services are, to our knowledge, not fully understood.

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
