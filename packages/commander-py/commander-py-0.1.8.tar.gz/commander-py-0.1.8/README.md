`commander` is a library that you can create beautiful class based cli application by using `argparse`.

## Installation

Only `python3.7+` required, no extra dependencies.

```shell
pip install commander-py
```

## Usage

Basic usage, let's greet someone :)

Create a file named `myapp.py`.

Import required classes from `commander` library

```python
from commander import Application
from commander import Command
```

Define your first command.

1. `create` is the method where you define your cli arguments
2. `handle` is the method where you use entered arguments.

```python
class GreetCommand(Command):
    name = "greet"
    description = "Greet command"

    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        """Create your cli arguments here"""

        parser.add_argument("-n", "--name", help="Name of sample")

    def handle(self, **arguments):
        """Do things with your arguments here"""

        name = arguments["name"]
        print(f"Greetings {name} :)")

```

Create your commander application and register the command then run.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = Application(name="myapp", description="My first commander application")
    app.register(GreetCommand)
    app.run()
```

**Now test your first application**

Simple usage.

```text
# Command
$ python myapp.py greet -n "John Doe"

# Output
Greetings John Doe :)
```
