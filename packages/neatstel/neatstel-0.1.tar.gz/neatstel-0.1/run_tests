# To enable python to discover tests, test files should be named
# test*.py and be located in a directory that includes an __init__.py
# file.

# For the test*.py files to be able to import the modules correctly,
# you should either run this command from the project root directory,
# or else set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to the project's
# root directory.

set -ex
# In the above line, "set -x" causes this script to exit as soon as any line fails. "set -e" causes each line of this script to be printed (with a + in front) before it is executed, so if a step fails, you can see from the travis log what command failed.

cd tests

# Example of running all tests for a specific module:
#python -m unittest -v test_particle_tracing
#python -m unittest -v test_particle_tracing -k test_orbit_energy_momentum

# Example of running a specific test that matches a pattern:
#python -m unittest -v -k test_orbit_energy_momentum

# Run all tests (-v for verbose):
python3 -m unittest -v
