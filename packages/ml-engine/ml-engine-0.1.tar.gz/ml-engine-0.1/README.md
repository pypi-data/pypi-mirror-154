# ml-engine: Machine Learning Engine 
This is an open-source program for creating machine learning programs. The procedures ml-engine employes are computationally intensive as the program will not only identify the ideal engine to use, but will also iterate over many architectures and hyperparameters so as to increase the probability of optimal convergence. 

# Installation

```
    $ pip install ml-engine
```
