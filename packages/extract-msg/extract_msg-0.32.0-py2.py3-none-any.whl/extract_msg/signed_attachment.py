        Saves the attachment data.

        The name of the file is determined by several factors. The first
        thing that is checked is if you have provided :param customFilename:
        to this function. If you have, that is the name that will be used.
        If no custom name has been provided and :param contentId: is True,
        the file will be saved using the content ID of the attachment. If
        it is not found or :param contentId: is False, the long filename
        will be used. If the long filename is not found, the short one will
        be used. If after all of this a usable filename has not been found, a
        random one will be used (accessible from `Attachment.randomFilename`).
        After the name to use has been determined, it will then be shortened to
        make sure that it is not more than the value of :param maxNameLength:.

        To change the directory that the attachment is saved to, set the value
        of :param customPath: when calling this function. The default save
        directory is the working directory.

        If you want to save the contents into a ZipFile or similar object,
        either pass a path to where you want to create one or pass an instance
        to :param zip:. If :param zip: is an instance, :param customPath: will
        refer to a location inside the zip file.
