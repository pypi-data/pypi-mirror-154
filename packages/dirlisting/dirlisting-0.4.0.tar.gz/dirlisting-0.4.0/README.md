# dirlisting

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/dirlisting/badge/?version=latest)](https://dirlisting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


Create a directory tree listing from a text file for use in documentation.

There are plenty of good tools out there to produce directory tree listings from an
existing directory structure. This tool handles the situation when you don't have and
don't want to create a directory structure for the sole purpose of producing a directory
tree listing for a document or email.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install dirlisting
```

## Usage

`dirlisting` can be used to create a directory tree listing that looks like those
created with the `tree` command, but from a text file instead of walking an actual
directory tree.

### From code

**Reading a file**

```python
from dirlisting.dirlisting import Dirlisting
with open("input.yaml") as f:
    listing = Dirlisting(f)
listing.print()
```

**From a string**

```
from dirlisting.dirlisting import Dirlisting
input = """
- topdir:
  - subdir1:
    - file1.txt
    - file2.txt
"""
Dirlisting(input).print()
```

### From the command line

Just use `dirlisting <filename>`.

``` none
dirlisting [OPTIONS] FILE

  Create a directory listing given an input FILE.

Options:
  --version              Show the version and exit.
  -s, --sort             Sort the directory entries.
  -d, --dirsfirst        List directories before files.
  -o, --output FILENAME  Output to this file.
  --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

### File format

The input file is a [yaml](https://yaml.org/) file. Each of the entries is treated as
part of a sequence and starts with a `-`. The files are final strings and the file name
comes after the dash (`- filename`). The directories are mappings and the directory name
is followed by a colon (`- dirname:`). A listing would look like the following.

:::::{grid} 2
::::{grid-item-card} YAML File
```yaml
- topdir:
  - emptydir:
  - file1.txt
  - file2.txt
  - subdir:
    - file3.txt
```
::::
::::{grid-item-card} Output
```
topdir
├── emptydir
├── file1.txt
├── file2.txt
└── subdir
    └── file3.txt
```
::::

When using the output option to save to a file, the file will be saved with "utf-8"
encoding. On a Mac or Linux machine this works seamlessly. There can be problems with
the console on Windows, but most modern editors can open the file with "utf-8" encoding.
