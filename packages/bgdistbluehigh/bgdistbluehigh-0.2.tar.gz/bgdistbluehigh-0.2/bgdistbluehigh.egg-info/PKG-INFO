Description: ## Project Description
        This project consists of a package created for calculations of Binomial and Gaussian
        distributions.
        
        ## binomial-gaussian-dist package
        The package calculates binomial and gaussian distributions along with probability 
        density functions. Also the package provides a way to add two distributions.
        
        ## Package Contents
        * __init__.py: file to import Binomial and Gaussian class from modules
        * BinomialDistribution.py: file to calculate and visualize Binomial Distribution
        * GaussianDistribution.py: file to calculate and visualize Gaussian Distribution
        * GeneralDistribution.py: file containing parent class for general distributions
