## Project Description
This project consists of a package created for calculations of Binomial and Gaussian
distributions.

## binomial-gaussian-dist package
The package calculates binomial and gaussian distributions along with probability 
density functions. Also the package provides a way to add two distributions.

## Package Contents
* __init__.py: file to import Binomial and Gaussian class from modules
* BinomialDistribution.py: file to calculate and visualize Binomial Distribution
* GaussianDistribution.py: file to calculate and visualize Gaussian Distribution
* GeneralDistribution.py: file containing parent class for general distributions
