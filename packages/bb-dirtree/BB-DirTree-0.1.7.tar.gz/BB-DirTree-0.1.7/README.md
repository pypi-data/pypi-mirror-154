### *Exclusions*

>Provide names of files or directories to exclude. To exclude multiple files/directories, quote entire list and seperate with a colon (**:**). Add a forward slash (**/**) to specify a directory name to exclude.

##### **Example:**
  
```bash
python -m bbdirtree --exclude "excluded dir:excluded file"
```

### *Regex*

>Prefix regex with *include=* or *exclude=*

>Seperate each regex with a space, quoting each individual argument.

##### _**Examples:**_

```bash
python -m bbdirtree --regex "exclude=.*\.ini$"

    # will exclude any files that have a *.ini* extension.

python -m bbdirtree --regex "include=.*\.mp3$"

    # will include only files with a *.mp3* extension.
```

>This has no effect on directories

>Multiple regex can be used by specifying **--regex** multiple times.
