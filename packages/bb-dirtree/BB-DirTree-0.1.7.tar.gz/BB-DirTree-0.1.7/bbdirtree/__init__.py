**Short**  | **Long**       | **Description**
---------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
-b         |   --base-dir   |  Set base directory  *Uses current directory if not specified*
-d         |   --depth      |  Integer to set the depth of directory tree  *ex: '0' will only print the base directory list*

-r         |   --regex      |  Use regex to include/exclude files/directories in tree  *See Regex*

  It is recommended to quote all paths

*Exclusions*

  Provide names of files or directories to exclude
  To exclude multiple files/directories, quote entire list and seperate with a colon (**:**)
  Add a forward slash (**/**) to specify a directory name to exclude

  Example:

    python -m bbdirtree --exclude "excluded dir:excluded file"

*Regex*

  Prefix regex with *include=* or *exclude=*
  Seperate each regex with a space, quoting each individual argument.

  Examples:

    python -m bbdirtree --regex "exclude=.*\.ini$"
      # will exclude any files that have a *.ini* extension.

    python -m bbdirtree --regex "include=.*\.mp3$"
      # will include only files with a *.mp3* extension.

  This has no effect on directories
  Multiple regex can be used by specifying **--regex** multiple times.
