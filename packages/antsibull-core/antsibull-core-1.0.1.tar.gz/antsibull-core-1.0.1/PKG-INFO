## Versioning and compatibility

From version 1.0.0 on, antsibull-core sticks to semantic versioning and aims at providing no backwards compatibility breaking changes during a major release cycle. We might make exceptions from this in case of security fixes for vulnerabilities that are severe enough.

## Creating a new release:

If you want to create a new release::

    vim pyproject.toml  # Make sure version number is correct
    vim changelogs/fragment/$VERSION_NUMBER.yml  # create 'release_summary:' fragment
    antsibull-changelog release --version $VERSION_NUMBER
    git add CHANGELOG.rst changelogs
    git commit -m "Release $VERSION_NUMBER."
    poetry build
    poetry publish  # Uploads to pypi.  Be sure you really want to do this

    git tag $VERSION_NUMBER
    git push --tags
    vim pyproject.toml  # Bump the version number to X.Y.Z.post0
    git commit -m 'Update the version number for the next release' pyproject.toml
    git push
