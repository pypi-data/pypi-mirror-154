Description: # Commune Bot
        
        A friendly Twitter bot built with [Munibot](https://github.com/amercader/munibot) that tweets aerial pictures of France's [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_France).
        
        ## Install and setup
        
        Install it with pip:
        
        ```
        pip install communebot-fr
        ```
        
        And follow the instructions on [Munibot's documentation](https://github.com/amercader/munibot#usage) regarding configuration and setup.
        
        This particular bot requires:
        
        * An [IGN geoservices](https://geoservices.ign.fr/) key to access the WMS service, which you can obtain [here](https://geoservices.ign.fr/documentation/diffusion/formulaire-de-commande-geoservices.html)
        * The backend SQLite database with communes data, which you can download from this repo (`data` folder)
        
        
        Both these should be referenced in the `[profile:fr]` section of your `munibot.ini` file:
        
        ```
        [profile:fr]
        ign_key=CHANGE_ME
        twitter_key=CHANGE_ME
        twitter_secret=CHANGE_ME
        db_path=/path/to/data/communes_fr.sqlite
        ```
        
        ### Patches
        
        As of April 2021 this bot requires a [patch in OWSLib](https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/pull/763) to be able to send headers as part of the WMS `GetMap` requests. The patch is included in the `data` folder.
