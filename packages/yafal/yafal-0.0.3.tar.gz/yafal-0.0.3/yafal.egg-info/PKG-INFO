YAFAL
=====

You are fake labels! is a library which employs Large Language Models (LLMs)
to detect fake labels for text classification.

It uses Huggingface Transformers library with the PyTorch backend.

For more information, refer to the auto-generated [documentation](https://yafal.llinguai.eus)

Installation
============

To install it, just use:

    pip install yafal

Generating the Docs
-------------------
To auto-generate the documentation you will also need the following imports

    pip install sphinx numpydoc

Current Limitations
===================

Currently, these are the existing limitations, help is appreciated: 

 - Multi-label fake-label detection is only supported for the "binary" encoding method.
 - Dataset Corruption:
   - No data-conditioning exists, i.e. P(X, Y_corrupt) = P(X)P(Y_corrupt)
   - There is no method to take into account a label-corruption confusion matrix: P(y_c | y))
 - Export to ONNX yet to be done
 - Sphinx Documentation
 - YAFALDocumentHandler
 - Test it on GPU settings
