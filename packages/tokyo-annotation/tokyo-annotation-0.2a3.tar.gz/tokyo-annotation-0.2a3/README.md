# Tokyo Annotation
![workflow status](https://github.com/dion-ricky/tokyo-annotation/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=release)

This is a prototype of an annotation propagation system based on provenance. I build this system to support the propagation of annotation across several different database and data storage systems.
