Description: # Testmon-skip-libaries
        
        This is a fork of pytest-testmon that adds functionality to ignore changes to
        libraries used by the code. The standard version of pytest-testmon looks not
        only at the python code for changes, but also versions of dependencies. This
        makes it unsuitable for sharing among developers (who may have a different local
        set of dependencies), or CI/CD systems where your local, staging and production
        environments may differ in the number and versions of dependencies used.
        
        From the original repo:
        
        # Testmon
        
        This is a pytest plug-in which automatically selects and re-executes only tests
        affected by recent changes. How is this possible in dynamic language like Python
        and how reliable is it? Read here: [Determining affected
        tests](https://testmon.org/determining-affected-tests.html)
        
        ## Quickstart
        
            pip install pytest-testmon-skip-libraries
        
            # build the dependency database and save it to .testmondata
            pytest --testmon
        
            # change some of your code (with test coverage)
        
            # only run tests affected by recent changes
            pytest --testmon
        
            # only run tests affected by recent changes while ignoring changes
            # to any libraries used by the code
            pytest --testmon --skip-libraries
