# Sabana python package

This package has the following helper classes to allow programmatic interaction with the Sabana platform from python:

- Program: constructs the series of steps to be executed in an instance deployed in the platform.
- Instance: is a handler to a instance deployed in the platform.

# Deploying an instance

Instances in Sabana are identified by a triple of user, instance, and tag.

After logging in, an instance can be deployed like this:

```python
from sabana import Instance

inst = Instance(user="pedro", instance="rtl_mmio", tag="0")
inst.up()
# Don't forget to stop the instance if you don't use it
inst.down()
```
