ZetaStitcher is a tool designed to stitch large volumetric images such as
those produced by Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopes.

Key features:

* able to handle datasets as big as 10<sup>12</sup> voxels
* multichannel images
* powerful and simple Python API to query arbitrary regions within the fused
volume

## How to install
On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, run these commands:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip libgl1 libglib2.0-0
pip3 install zetastitcher
```

## Docker image
To build a docker image with ZetaStitcher:
```
make docker
```
You can call the stitching commands using an ephemeral container like this:
```
docker run -it -v`pwd`:/home --rm zetastitcher stitch-align -h
docker run -it -v`pwd`:/home --rm zetastitcher stitch-fuse -h
```
