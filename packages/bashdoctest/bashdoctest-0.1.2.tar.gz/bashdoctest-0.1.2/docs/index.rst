Bashdoctest Command Line Application Tester
===========================================

Bashdoctest is a doctest-style testing tool for command-line applications. It wraps other testing suites and allows them to be tested in docstrings.
It is a fork of the original clatter repo by Michael Delgado, which appears to have gone silent. This package contains further improvements.
