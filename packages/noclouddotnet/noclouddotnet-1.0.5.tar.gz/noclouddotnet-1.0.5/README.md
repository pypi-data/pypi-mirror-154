NoCloud.Net
===========

Cloud-init is the *industry standard* multi-distribution method for
cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all
major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud
infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

Cloud instances are initialized from a disk image and instance data:

* Cloud metadata
* User data (optional)
* Vendor data (optional)

NoCloud.Net is a back-end for the nocloud/net datasource.

NoCloud.Net also supports cloud-init's phone-home feature.
