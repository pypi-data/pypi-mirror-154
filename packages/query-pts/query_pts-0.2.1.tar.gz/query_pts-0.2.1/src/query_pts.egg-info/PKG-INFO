# Query_pts 

A package for calculate barycentric coordinates in the tetrahedras.

### Dependency
This package relies on `cuda 10`, which has been tested on `pytorch 1.7.1` and `cuda 10.2`.

### Usage
```
import torch
import query_pts
tet_idx, barycentric = query_pts.cal_barycentric(q_pts, verts, tets, indexes, 4)
Args:
    q_pts (torch.tensor): the query points, [Nq,3]
    verts (torch.tensor): the vertices tethedra, [NV,3]
    tets (torch.tensor): the vertex index of each tet, [NT,4]
    K (int): the nearest neighbors for searching to accelerate query
    use_cuda (bool, optional): _description_. Defaults to True.
Return:
    tet_idx (torch.tensor): the tet which containing the query point, [Nq,]
    barycentric (torch.tensor): corresponding barycentric coordinates, [Nq,4]
```
If a point is not in any tetrahedras, the tet idx is set to `-1` and barycentric coordinates are set to `[0,0,0,0]`.
