Negative onsets are allowed, to account for events that occur prior to the first stored data point. For example, in case there is an in-scanner training phase that begins before the scanning sequence has started events from this sequence should have negative onset time counting down to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume.\nIf any data points have been discarded before forming the data file (for example, 'dummy volumes' in BOLD fMRI), a time of 0 corresponds to the first stored data point and not the first acquired data point.",

There are no restrictions on the file formats of the stimuli files, but they should be stored in the /stimuli folder (under the root folder of the dataset; with optional subfolders). The values under the stim_file column correspond to a path relative to /stimuli. For example images/cat03.jpg will be translated to /stimuli/images/cat03.jpg."},
