**Malaya-Speech** is a Speech-Toolkit library for bahasa Malaysia, powered by Deep Learning Tensorflow.

Documentation
--------------

Proper documentation is available at https://malaya-speech.readthedocs.io/

Installing from the PyPI
----------------------------------

CPU version
::

    $ pip install malaya-speech

GPU version
::

    $ pip install malaya-speech[gpu]

Only **Python 3.6.0 and above** and **Tensorflow 1.15.0 and above** are supported.

We recommend to use **virtualenv** for development. All examples tested on Tensorflow version 1.15.4, 1.15.5, 2.4.1, 2.5 and 2.9.
