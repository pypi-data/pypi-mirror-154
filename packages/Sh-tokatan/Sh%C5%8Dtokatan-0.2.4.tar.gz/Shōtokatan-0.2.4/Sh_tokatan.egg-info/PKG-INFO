## Examples of How To Use some functions.


```python
import Shotokatan as Shtan


files = Shtan.search_files('b') #will make a list with files that have the letter "b"

file = Shtan.shou_pages('.mid', '.',)

output = Shtan.console('start notepad')

clock = Shtan.check_time() # output : 16:30

data = Shtan.check_date('%Y-%m-%d') # output: 2022-04-17

Shtan.openweb('T', 'youtube.com', 'chrome') # pressing T, he will open youtube on chrome

Shtan.click(600, 500) # mouse click on X, Y

hex_color = Shtan.rgb_to_hex((255, 0, 0)) #return red color (255,0 , 0) in to hex

rgb_color = Shtan.hex_to_rgb(hex_color)

float_value = Shtan.random_num(0, 100, 2) # output: random float value

int_value = Shtan.random_num(0, 100, 1) # output: random int value

content = Shtan.read_midi('file.txt') # output: abc123 --> (file_content)

color_pixel = Shtan.detect_pixel(500, 500) # output: some color on that pixel. Ex: (100, 50, 255)

Shtan.write_file(['Hello', '123', '44pb'], 'some.txt', 1, '/game') # write content ['Hello', '123', '44pb'], in /game/some.txt and keep content on some.txt.
