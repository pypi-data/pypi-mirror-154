## Clone Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/galoget/gpp-cpass-decrypt
```

## Install Dependencies

This tool has 2 dependencies:

* [pycryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)
* [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

In order to avoid conflicts with any other installed modules in your system, it is recommended (not mandatory) to use a virtual environment (`virtualenv`).

Both dependencies are included in `requirements.txt` and can be installed in any of the following ways (just use one method):

#### Method 1
By doing the automated installation from PyPi with `pip3`, this command will install all dependencies (`pip3` **MUST** be installed in your system):

```sh
pip3 install gpp-cpass-decrypt
```

With this method you can use the tool as any other command without calling it with Python (don't forget to add your pip binary path to your PATH variable).

In Kali Linux this is the default path you need to add to your `PATH` environment variable.
```sh
/home/kali/.local/bin
```

Then, simply run:

```sh
gpp_cpass_decrypt -c <base64_encoded_cpassword>
```

#### Method 2
By using `pip3` and installing the dependencies manually (`pip3` **MUST** be installed in your system):

```sh
pip3 install pycryptodome colorama
```

#### Method 3
By using `pip3` and `requirements.txt`. Again `pip3` **MUST** be installed in your system:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Method 4
By using setuptools:

```sh
python3 setup.py install
```

From Method 2 to Method 4. In case you don't want to install the tool in your system. You can use it as a Python script that is not managed by `pip`:

```
python3 gpp_cpass_decrypt.py -c <base64_encoded_cpassword>
```

## Running the tool
You can run the tool with any of the following commands. They are equivalent:

```sh
python3 gpp_cpass_decrypt.py -c <base64_encoded_cpassword>
python3 gpp_cpass_decrypt.py --cpassword <base64_encoded_cpassword>
```

## Execution Example

#### Command:
Installed using Method 1:

```sh
gpp_cpass_decrypt -c "gtTqxKHj4RWsxHWcZcWtM8j7XbxiL7w+SwIyQbAetjEUfqBg2HmTklEXlDHuQPgE3NyuCKZ9Nu3oeXaeSt+9JQ=="
```

#### Expected Output:
```
Decrypted Password: Hackem Cybersecurity Research Group
```
