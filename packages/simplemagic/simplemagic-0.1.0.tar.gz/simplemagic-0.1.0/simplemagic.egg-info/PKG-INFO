Summary: Simple file magic. We try to get file's mimetype using 'file-magic', 'command file' and 'puremagic'. On linux we need system package 'file-libs' which mostly already installed. On MacOS we need system package 'libimage' which can be installed by 'brew install libmagic'. On windows we need file command which can be install by 'pacman -S file' within msys2. If system package missing, we try to get the file's mimetype using 'puremagic' which is write in pure python without any extra depends.

# simplemagic

Simple file magic. We try to get file's mimetype using 'file-magic', 'command file' and 'puremagic'. On linux we need system package 'file-libs' which mostly already installed. On MacOS we need system package 'libimage' which can be installed by 'brew install libmagic'. On windows we need file command which can be install by 'pacman -S file' within msys2. If system package missing, we try to get the file's mimetype using 'puremagic' which is write in pure python without any extra depends.

## Install

```
pip3 install simplemagic
```

## System requirements

### Linux

- file-libs

Mostly it is installed already, and you can installed it with command:

```
yum install file-libs
```

### MacOS

- libmagic

You can installed it with command:

```
brew install libmagic
```

### Windows

libmagic mostly not working on windows. Suggest you install msys2 on in system, and in msys2 you can install libmagic with command:

```
pacman -S file
```

Add msys2's bin path to your system's PATH env. We can call the external command `file` to get the mimetype of a file.

## APIS

- simplemagic.get_mimetype_by_stream
- simplemagic.get_mimetype_by_filename
- simplemagic.guess_all_extensions

You can read the source code to find other private apis which maybe you will need to reset the global settings or running env.

## Examples

```
import simplemagic

ext = ".docx"
filename = "ok.docx"
mimetype = simplemagic.get_mimetype_by_filename(filename)
ok_exts = simplemagic.guess_all_extensions(mimetype)
if ext in ok_exts:
    print("the file content is match with the file suffix...")
```

## Notice

Always upgrade your libmagic to the latest, old libmagic may get wrong answer.

## Compatibility
