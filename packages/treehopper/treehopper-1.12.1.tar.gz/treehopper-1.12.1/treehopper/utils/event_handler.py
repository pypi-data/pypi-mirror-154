    """A simple event handling class, which manages callbacks to be

    Attributes:
        callbacks: a list of callbacks that have registered to this event
        sender: the sender (captured by the constructor)

    \section using Subscribing to events
    This class uses C# syntax for subscribing/unsubscribing to events. You may either declare a plain function as a handler, or you can use a lambda.

    Regardless, the first argument with which your method will be called is the "sender" of the event, which is always the class the %EventHandler is instantiated inside (it's *not* the %EventHandler object itself).

    The second argument is the event. Unlike our strongly-typed EventArgs classes in C#, Java, and C++, this event class is more Pythonic: raw event values are published as the second argument of this event handler, removing the need to unpack the event.

    Because this is not strongly typed, be sure to read the documentation so you know what type to expect.

    Here's an example of subscribing to the Pin.analog_voltage_changed event using a lambda:

        >>> board = find_boards()[0]
        >>> board.connect()
        >>> pin = board.pins[0]
        >>> pin.mode = PinMode.AnalogInput
        >>> pin.analog_voltage_changed += lambda sender, value: print(value)

    Though you could just as easily pass the name of a function in place of the `lambda` in-line statement. Imagine having a ``, then passing it to the event:

        >>> def my_event_handler(sender, value):
        >>>     print(value)
        >>>
        >>> pin.analog_voltage_changed += my_event_handler

    \section publishing Publishing events
    You can use this module in your own classes to publish events. Simply initialize a variable as an    EventHandler:

        >>> my_event = EventHandler(self)

    Then call the event just like a function:

        >>> my_event(0.5)
