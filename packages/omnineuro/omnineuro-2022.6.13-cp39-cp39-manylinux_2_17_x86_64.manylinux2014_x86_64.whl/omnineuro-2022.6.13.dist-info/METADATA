# omni

`omni` is a Python/C++17 library for image registration in neuroimaging and
other related things. It provides some useful and convenient APIs for developing 
neuroimaging tools. These are used to develop implementations of software tools
I (and others) are currently developing.

Current software tools list:

- ### [Synth](#synth-1)
