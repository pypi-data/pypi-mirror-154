        Buyers of the straddle hope that the underlying moves enough to either exceed the straddle price by expiration or that the underlying moves enough to profitably “gamma scalp” the underlying.
        Gamma scalps are the proceeds from delta rebalancing activity that volatility buyers benefit from.
        The opposite is true for straddle sellers, straddle sellers hope that the underlying remains relatively stable and therefor they enjoy theta decay from the short straddle position in excess of gamma scalping outflows.

        CALCULATION:
        The straddles are constructed by first identifying the forward/underlying price, not the spot price.
        This is because for hedging purposes the underlying/forward is the appropriate instrument to use.
        The straddle is then constructed by choosing the strike price closest to the current fwd/underlying price.
        Both the call and put will have identical strike prices.
        Vega and Theta numbers are calculated using the Black-Scholes model with the mid/mark price and forward price as the input parameters.

        % OF SPOT CALCULATION
        $ Value of Straddle / Current $ Spot
        Despite the straddle being constructed using underlying/forward prices, the % of spot chart compares the straddle cost to the value of the current spot price.

        This method captures total premium to spot. Both the premium from the straddle and the premium implied by the forward/underlying prices.

        At expiration everything resolves to spot.

      Explanation:
       Why do traders like this endpoint?
        It's an industry axiom that the at-the-money (ATM) volatility chart is often viewed as the "truest" option volatility, because options that are ATM have the most embedded optionality.
        Fixed maturity ATM volatility ensures that users are analyzing an identical product overtime.
        This endpoint provides various fixed maturities (7-day, 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, 180-day), enabling users to measure the "term structure" throughout time.
        More info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_l--D3xTLI

        Calculation:
        ATM options are first determined by isolating the nearest out-of-the-money (OTM) puts and calls, with respect to the underlying/forward prices.
        The ATM options are then weighted to account for varying distances from underlying/forward to strike.
        In order to calculate fixed maturities, the implied volatility is first converted into variance, then linearly interpolated to the target maturity and finally converted back into implied volatility.

      Explanation:
        Why do traders like this endpoint?
        When moving out into the "wings" of options (aka. farther out-of-the-money options) implied volatilities begin to differ between equidistant options.
        In this case, distance is measured by delta (Δ).
        The reason for this difference in implied volatility is due to "Volatility Path". Meaning, the option market might expect higher volatility/momentum during a market crash of 20% versus a market rally of 20% (or down to the -Δ25 versus up to the Δ25).
        More info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px6DewFrJeA

        Calculation:
        Target deltas are first calculated by weighting the nearest periphery options to account for varying distances from the target.
        In order to calculate fixed maturities, the implied volatility is first converted into variance, then linearly interpolated to the target maturity and finally converted back into implied volatility.

        Why do traders like this endpoint?
        Options prices are often translated into "implied volatility" but how the underlying crypto-currency actually moved in the past is measured as "realized volatility" (or "historical volatility").
        Parkinson Volatility is an efficient estimator of volatility since crypto currencies trade continuously.
        Given selected measurement-windows, the realized volatility can vary a lot. Short-term measurements capture the current environments better, while longer measurement windows approximate the average realized volatility.

        More info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZRT3lRdmo0

        Calculation:
        Annualized volatility assumes 365 days
        Parkinson Volatility = √ {[ ( 1 ÷ 4ln2) × Σ (ln(high/low))² ]1/n}
        Rolling windows will average the variance before applying the square root to find the volatility value.
        This is done in order to respect Jensen's inequality, which states that the average of the square roots is smaller than the square root of the average.
        Rolling windows use a full dataset but display only the selected date range.
        For example: A 30-day date range will display 30 days of the fully calculated 365 rolling window.

        Futures, by definition, settle to spot prices (aka "index price") upon expiration. Due to these derivatives expiring sometime in the future, the prices today may deviate from spot. These deviations from spot create an "implicit" interest rate to the futures contract. This futures contract is also known as the "basis".
        Why would anyone pay an implicit interest rate when they could merely trade spot? Futures provide leverage and are therefore capital-efficient. The basis, in part, can be thought of as the cost of capital for the leverage. (In reality the basis, which is a function of supply and demand, is traded for many reasons beyond cost of capital).

        Calculation:
        Raw Basis = [(Midprice) / (index price)] - 1
        Annualized Percent Spread = (Raw Basis) X [(525,600)/ (minutes until futures expiration)]

        Unlike futures contracts, perpetual swaps have no expiration date. Any deviation between spot prices and perpetual swaps can persist indefinitely since there is no final expiration settlement process.
        In order to keep spot and perpetual prices in-line, a funding mechanism is paid between counter-parties.

        Calculation:
        When the funding rate is positive, long position holders pay funding to the short position holders; when the funding rate is negative, short position holders pay funding to the long position holders. The funding rate is expressed as an 8-hour interest rate, and is calculated at any given time as follows:
        Premium Rate = ((Mark Price - Deribit Index) / Deribit Index) * 100%
        Sequentially, the funding rate is derived from the premium rate by applying a damper.

        If the premium rate is within -0.05% and 0.05% range, the actual funding rate will be reduced to 0.00%.
        If the premium rate is lower than -0.05%, then the actual funding rate will be the premium rate + 0.05%.
        If the premium rate is higher than 0.05%, then the actual funding rate will be the premium rate - 0.05%.
        Additionally, the funding rate is capped at -/+0.5%, expressed as an 8-hour interest rate.
        Funding Rate = Maximum (0.05%, Premium Rate) + Minimum (-0.05%, Premium Rate)

        Time Fraction = Funding Rate Time Period / 8 hours
        The actual funding payment is calculated by multiplying the funding rate by the position size and the time fraction.
        Funding Payment = Funding Rate * Position Size * Time Fraction

        The futures basis represents the "implicit" interest rate paid by futures traders.
        At expiration the futures price will equal the spot price by definition and exchange rules.
        Until expiration, futures price can deviate greatly from spot prices (this is due to leverage or short demand) and the basis is the "translation" of this deviation into an APY.
        This endpoint returns the basis for 30-day, 60-day and 90-day fixed maturities.

        Calculation:
        Raw Basis = [(Mid-price) ÷ (Index price)] - 1
        Annualized Basis = (Raw Basis) * [(525,600)/ (minutes until futures expiration)]

        Unlike futures contracts, perpetual swaps have no expiration date. Any deviation between spot prices and perpetual swaps can persist indefinitely since there is no final expiration settlement process.
        In order to keep spot and perpetual prices in-line, a funding mechanism is paid between counter-parties.

        Calculation:
        At the start of each hour, an account receives USDC (if F is positive) or pays USDC (if F is negative) in an amount equal to:
        F = (-1) × S × P × R

        Where:
        S is the size of the position (positive if long, negative if short)
        P is the oracle (index) price for the market
        R is the funding rate (as a 1-hour rate)
        At the end of each hour, the 1-hour premium is calculated as the simple average (i.e. TWAP) of the 60 premiums calculated over the course of the last hour. In addition to the premium component, each market has a fixed interest rate component that aims to account for the difference in interest rates of the base and quote currencies. The funding rate is then:

        Funding Rate = (Premium Component / 8) + Interest Rate Component
        Currently, the interest rate component for all dYdX markets is 0.00125% (equivalent to 0.01% per 8 hours). For markets with no interest rate component, the funding rate is simply the one-hour premium.
