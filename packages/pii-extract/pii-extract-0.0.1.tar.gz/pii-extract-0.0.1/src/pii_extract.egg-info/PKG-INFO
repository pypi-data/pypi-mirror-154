Description: # Pii Extractor
        
        This repository builds a Python package that performs PII detection for text
        data i.e. extraction of PII (Personally Identifiable Information aka Personal
        Data) items existing in the text.
        
        The PII Tasks in the package are structured by language & country, since many
        of the PII elements are language- and/or -country dependent.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        The package 
         * needs at least Python 3.8
         * needs the pii-data base package
         * uses the python-stdnum package to validate identifiers, and needs the 
        
        ## Usage
        
        The package can be used:
         * As an API, in two flavors: function-based API and object-based API
         * As a command-line tool
        
        For details, see the usage document.
        
        
        ## Building
        
        The provided Makefile can be used to process the package:
         * `make pkg` will build the Python package, creating a file that can be
           installed with `pip`
         * `make unit` will launch all unit tests (using pytest, so pytest must be
           available)
         * `make install` will install the package in a Python virtualenv. The
           virtualenv will be chosen as, in this order:
             - the one defined in the `VENV` environment variable, if it is defined
             - if there is a virtualenv activated in the shell, it will be used
             - otherwise, a default is chosen as `/opt/venv/bigscience` (it will be
               created if it does not exist)
