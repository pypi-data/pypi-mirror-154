# Tokyo Lineage
This is a prototype of lineage extraction library. I built this system to enable lineage extraction using ETL tools and Marquez. On this library, I provide an integration with Airflow. For other ETL tools, you can develop the integrations on your own and please kindly contribute to this library by sharing the integration code.
