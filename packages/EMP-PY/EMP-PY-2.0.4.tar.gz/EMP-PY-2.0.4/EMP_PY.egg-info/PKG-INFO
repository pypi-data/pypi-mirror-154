# EMP-Py

EMP Python Package repository, currently at version 2.0.4.

Functions for estimating EMP (Expected Maximum Profit Measure) in [Credit Risk Scoring](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221714003105) and [Customer Churn Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6165289), according to Verbraken et al (2013, 2014).

## Installation

```python
pip install EMP-PY
```

## Usage

```python
from EMP.metrics import empCreditScoring

scores = [0.34, 0.44, 0.67, 0.83]
classes = [0, 0, 1, 0]
k = 2

# By default will print and return output (no rounding)
empCreditScoring(scores, classes)

# Will only return output (no rounding)
empCreditScoring(scores, classes, print_output=False)

# Will only print output (no rounding)
empCreditScoring(scores, classes, return_output=False)

# Will print and return output with k decimal points
empCreditScoring(scores, classes, rounding=k)
```

The functions have been co-authored by Thomas Verbraken, Seppe van den Brucke and [Cristián Bravo](https://github.com/CBravoR). Python translation by [Emiliano Peñaloza](https://emilianopp.com/#/home) and Alexander Hemming.
