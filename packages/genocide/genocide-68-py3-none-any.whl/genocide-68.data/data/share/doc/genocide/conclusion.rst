"Under the Rome Statute, the Court may only exercise jurisdicition over
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, as defined in the Rome
Statute (Articles 6 to 8), when committed on or after 1 July 2002 (Article
11)."

If it is after 2002, then outside the jurisdiction must be an definition of
article 6 problem. The court must define what todo if the definitions don't
apply, there are genocides practiced against different groups then those
mentioned. The laws of the king are not based on race, religion but on the
"sub groups in society" like all the elderly and handicapped (Wzd), all the
criminals (Wfz) and all wicked (WvGGZ).

Article 15 doesn't need cooperation, Court and Prosecutor can themselves
decide to give an arrest warrent for the kind and have him stop doing his
genocide.
