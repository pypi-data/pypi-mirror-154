# invesyservertools

A small set of useful tools an a server, especially for terminal scripts.

Why "invesy"? Invesy (from German **In**halts**ve**rwaltungs**sy**stem == content management system) is a closed source cms I created with Thomas Macher. It's only used in-house, that's why we didn't bother making it open source.
