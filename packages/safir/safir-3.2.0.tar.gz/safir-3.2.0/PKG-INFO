############################################
Safir is the SQuaRE Framework for Roundtable
############################################

Roundtable_ is the SQuaRE application and bot deployment platform, hosted on Kubernetes with Argo CD.
Safir is a Python package that lets you develop Roundtable bots, based on the `FastAPI`_ asyncio web framework.

Install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install safir

The best way to create a new Safir-based Roundtable bot is with the `fastapi_safir_app`_ template.

Features
========

- Set up an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` as part of the application start-up and shutdown lifecycle.
- Set up structlog-based logging.
- Middleware for attaching request context to the logger to include a request UUID, method, and route in all log messages.
- Process ``X-Forwarded-*`` headers to determine the source IP and related information of the request.
- Gather and structure standard metadata about your application.
- Operate a distributed Redis job queue with arq_ using convenient clients, testing mocks, and a FastAPI dependency.

Developing Safir
================

The best way to start contributing to Safir is by cloning this repository creating a virtual environment, and running the init command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lsst-sqre/safir.git
   cd safir
   make init

Change log

.. Headline template:
   X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)

3.2.0 (2022-05-13)
==================

- New support for `arq <https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io>`__, the Redis-based asyncio distributed queue package.
  The ``safir.arq`` module provides an arq client and metadata/result data classes with a mock implementation for testing.
  The FastAPI dependency, ``safir.dependencies.arq.arq_dependency``, provides a convenient way to use the arq client from HTTP handlers.

3.1.0 (2022-06-01)
==================

- Add new FastAPI middleware ``CaseInsensitiveQueryMiddleware`` to aid in implementing the IVOA protocol requirement that the keys of query parameters be case-isensitive.

3.0.3 (2022-05-16)
==================

- Correctly handle the possibility that ``request.client`` is ``None``.

3.0.2 (2022-03-25)
==================

- Fix handling of passwords containing special characters such as ``@`` and ``/`` in ``safir.database``.

3.0.1 (2022-02-24)
==================

- ``safir.database`` retains the port in the database URL, if provided.

3.0.0 (2022-02-23)
==================

- ``XForwardedMiddleware`` no longer sets ``forwaded_proto`` in the request state and instead directly updates the request scope so that subsequent handlers and middleware believe the request scheme is that given by an ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header.
  This fixes the scheme returned by other request methods and attributes such as ``url_for`` in cases where the service is behind an ingress that terminates TLS.
- Add new FastAPI dependencies ``auth_dependency`` and ``auth_logger_dependency`` from the ``safir.dependencies.gafaelfawr`` module.
  ``auth_dependency`` returns the username of the user authenticated via Gafaelfawr (pulled from the ``X-Auth-Request-User`` header.
  ``auth_logger_dependency`` returns the same logger as ``logger_dependency`` but with the ``user`` parameter bound to the username from ``auth_dependency``.
- Add utility functions to initialize a database and create a sync or async session.
  The session creation functions optionally support a health check to ensure the database schema has been initialized.
- Add new FastAPI dependency ``db_session_dependency`` that creates a task-local async SQLAlchemy session.
- Add utility functions ``datetime_from_db`` and ``datetime_to_db`` to convert between timezone-naive UTC datetimes stored in a database and timezone-aware UTC datetimes used elsewhere in a program.
- Add a ``run_with_async`` decorator that runs the decorated async function synchronously.
  This is primarily useful for decorating Click command functions (for a command-line interface) that need to make async calls.

2.4.2 (2022-01-24)
==================

- Add a very basic and limited implementation of ``list_namespaced_pod`` to ``safir.testing.kubernetes``.

2.4.1 (2022-01-14)
==================

- In the Kubernetes mock API, change the expected body for ``patch_namespaced_custom_object_status`` to reflect the need to send a JSON patch for the entirety of the ``/status`` path in order to work around a kubernetes_asyncio bug.

2.4.0 (2022-01-13)
==================

- Add an ``initialize_kubernetes`` helper function to load Kubernetes configuration.
  Add the ``safir.testing.kubernetes`` module, which can be used to mock the Kubernetes API for testing.
  To use the new Kubernetes support, depend on ``safir[kubernetes]``.

2.3.0 (2021-12-13)
==================

- When logging in JSON format, use ``severity`` instead of ``level`` for the log level for compatibility with Google Log Explorer.
- In the FastAPI ``logger_dependency``, add log information about the incoming requst in a format compatible with Google Log Explorer.

2.2.0 (2021-11-09)
==================

- Restore previous ``http_client_dependency`` behavior by enabling following redirects by default.
  This adjusts for the change of defaults in httpx 0.20.0.

2.1.1 (2021-10-29)
==================

- Require structlog 21.2.0 and adjust logger configuration of exception handling for the expectations of that version.

2.1.0 (2021-08-09)
==================

- Add ``safir.models.ErrorModel``, which is a model of the error message format preferred by FastAPI.
  Using the model is not necessary but it's helpful to reference it in API documentation to generate more complete information about the error messages.
- Mark all FastAPI dependencies as async so that FastAPI doesn't run them in an external thread pool.

2.0.1 (2021-06-24)
==================

- Defer creation of ``httpx.AsyncClient`` until the first time it is requested.
  Allow re-creation after ``aclose()``, which makes it easier to write test suites.

2.0.0 (2021-06-21)
==================

As of this release, Safir is a helper library for FastAPI applications instead of aiohttp applications.
Much of the library has changed.
Authors of software that uses Safir should read the documentation again as part of the upgrade to FastAPI.

Included in this release is:

- A FastAPI dependency to provide a structlog logger as configured by the ``safir.logging`` package, replacing the aiohttp middleware.
- A FastAPI dependency to provide a global ``httpx.AsyncClient``, replacing the middleware that provided an aiohttp client.
- Starlette (FastAPI) middleware to parse ``X-Forwarded-*`` headers and update request information accordingly.
- ``safir.metadata.get_metadata`` now returns a Pydantic_ model.

.. _Pydantic: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/

As of this release, Safir only supports Python 3.8 or later.

1.0.0 (2021-06-18)
==================

Safir v1 will be the major release supporting aiohttp.
Starting with Safir v2, Safir will become a support library for FastAPI_ applications.

.. _FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

This release has no significant difference from 0.2.0.
The version bump is to indicate that the aiohttp support is stable.

0.2.0 (2021-06-10)
==================

- ``configure_logging`` now supports an optional ``add_timestamp`` parameter (false by default) that adds a timestamp to each log message.
- Update dependencies.

0.1.1 (2021-01-14)
==================

- Fix duplicated log output when logging is configured multiple times.
- Update dependencies.

0.1.0 (2020-02-26)
==================

- The first release of Safir featuring:
  
  - ``safir.http`` for adding an ``aiohttp.ClientSession`` to your application.
  - ``safir.logging`` for configuring structlog loggers.
  - ``safir.metadata`` helps your gather and structure metadata about your application for publishing on metadata endpoints.
  - ``safir.middleware`` includes a logging middleware that adds a logger with bound context about the request to your Request object.
  - Documentation about these features and a tutorial for starting a new application with the ``roundtable_aiohttp_bot`` template.
