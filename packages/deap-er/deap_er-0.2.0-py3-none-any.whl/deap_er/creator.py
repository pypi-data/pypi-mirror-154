"""
The :mod:`~deap.creator` is a meta-factory allowing to create classes that
will fulfill the needs of your evolutionary algorithms. In effect, new
classes can be built from any imaginable type, from :class:`list` to
:class:`set`, :class:`dict`, :class:`~deap.gp.PrimitiveTree` and more,
providing the possibility to implement genetic algorithms, genetic
programming, evolution strategies, particle swarm optimizers, and many more.
"""

import copy
import warnings

"""
Some classes in Python's standard library as well as third party library
may be in part incompatible with the logic used in DEAP. To palliate
this problem, the method :func:`create` uses the dictionary
`class_replacers` to identify if the base type provided is problematic, and if
so  the new class inherits from the replacement class instead of the
original base class.

`class_replacers` keys are classes to be replaced and the values are the
replacing classes.

def create(name, base, **kargs):

    Creates a new class named *name* inheriting from *base* in the
    :mod:`~deap.creator` module. The new class can have attributes defined by
    the subsequent keyword arguments passed to the function create. If the
    argument is a class (without the parenthesis), the __init__ function is
    called in the initialization of an instance of the new object and the
    returned instance is added as an attribute of the class' instance.
    Otherwise, if the argument is not a class, (for example an :class:`int`),
    it is added as a "static" attribute of the class.

    :param name: The name of the class to create.
    :param base: A base class from which to inherit.
    :param attribute: One or more attributes to add on instantiation of this
                      class, optional.

    The following is used to create a class :class:`Foo` inheriting from the
    standard :class:`list` and having an attribute :attr:`bar` being an empty
    dictionary and a static attribute :attr:`spam` initialized to 1. ::

        create("Foo", list, bar=dict, spam=1)

    This above line is exactly the same as defining in the :mod:`creator`
    module something like the following. ::

        class Foo(list):
            spam = 1

    usage.
