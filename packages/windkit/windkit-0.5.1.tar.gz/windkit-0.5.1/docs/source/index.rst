WindKit
=======

WindKit provides a Pythonic interface to read, write, and analyse many of the file formats used in the WAsP wind resource assessment program. Over time the project will include additional file types, and work to standardize the structures that are used in Wind Resource Assessment.

WindKit is built to include robust metadata for all objects, allowing for easier interoperability and reusability of different data sets.

.. note:: WindKit does not provide an interface to calculate WAsP results. For that you will need PyWAsP, which will be launched later in 2022. PyWAsP will be a commercial tool, and require a license fee.
