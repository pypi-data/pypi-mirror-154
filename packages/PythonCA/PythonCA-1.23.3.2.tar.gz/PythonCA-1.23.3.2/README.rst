installation
----------------
A setup script of this module need to know the location of your EPICS installation.
Please EPICSROOT environment variable as the path where your EPICS base is.

#. download source package from PyPI site.

#. exapnd the file at appropriate directory

#. goto this directory and run

   env EPICS_ROOT=/your/epics/root python3 setup.py build clean install

   

memo:2019.4.19
-----------------

This module is updated so that it is now compatible with 
both Python2.x (x>6) and Python3.y.
(I just tested with Python2.7 and Python3.7).

This module also include calib module which is developed with Cython.
It is still under development. Once this module is completed,
ca314.cpp will be obsoleted and will be replaced by python module based on
calib.


memo:2020.11.17
--------------------
_ca_kek.py and _ca314.cpp are tweaked to support "SyncGroup" function.

_ca_kek.py is also clean-upped with 2to3 and pylint.

memo:2020.11.19
--------------------
A crash on centOS was caused by incorrect data conversion format in PyArg_ParseTuple in _ca314.cpp.
A size of data specified by the fromat should be matched with the size of the correspondig argument.
Functions, sg_test/sg_reset/sg_state, were  affected by this incorrect format characters.

Most of python scripts in sample/ directory now works on both python2 and python3.
I don't have PyQt, wxPython in the current test platform, so scripts using PyQt or wxPython
are not tested( but converted with 2to3 anyway).
You may need to install future module (not __future__ module) into your python2 enviroment,
to test sicripts using tkinter module.
