"""
note:
    runtime_stubgen: collect runtime information.
    static_stubgen: not implemented yet.

workflow:
    1. set an entrance directory to watch.
    2. caller explicitly calls (or just imports) modules who are decorated by
       flask_native_stubs. flask_native_stubs will detect them and record their
       info to `.runtime_stubgen > runtime_info_collection` dict.
    3. export collected info to output directory.
    4. (optional) reset `runtime_info_collection` dict.
