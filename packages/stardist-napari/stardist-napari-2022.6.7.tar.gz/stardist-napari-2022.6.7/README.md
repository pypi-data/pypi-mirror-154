This project provides the [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin for [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist), a deep learning based 2D and 3D object detection method with star-convex shapes. StarDist has originally been developed (see [papers](https://github.com/stardist/stardist#stardist---object-detection-with-star-convex-shapes)) for the segmentation of densely packed cell nuclei in challenging images with low signal-to-noise ratios. The plugin allows to apply pretrained and custom trained models from within napari.

## Installation & Usage

Install the plugin with `pip install stardist-napari` or from within napari via `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Package(s)â€¦`. If you want GPU-accelerated prediction, please read the more detailed [installation instructions](https://github.com/stardist/stardist#installation) for StarDist.

You can activate the plugin in napari via `Plugins > StarDist: StarDist`. Example images for testing are provided via `File > Open Sample > StarDist`.

For a more detailed demonstration of the plugin, please [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km1_TnUQ4FM&list=PLilvrWT8aLuZCaOkjucLjvDu2YRtCS-JT&index=5).

There's no dedicated documentation yet, but the most important parameters are identical to those of our [StarDist ImageJ/Fiji plugin](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-imagej), which are documented [here](https://imagej.net/plugins/stardist#usage).

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/stardist/stardist#how-to-cite).
