##### Author :

#### Description : 
A simple and tiny FortiGate Configuration file parser.
It takes FortiGate Configuration as input, and output as python defaultdict.
The core parsing fuctions implemented in less than 100 lines of code.


##### Install :
pip install pyfgtconflib


#### Usage :
In the source repository: https://github.com/fortinetps/pyfgtconflib
A demo script called "import_export.py" in tests folder.
This script open a FortiGate configuration file, parses configuration file into python dictionary, 
and print the dictionary out with nicely formatted text.
You can redirect the output to a file, to compare the original input FortiGate configuration file, 
so you could verify the config paring (import) and config dictionary printing out (export) works.

A demo script called "remove_password.py" in tests folder.
This script open a FortiGate configuration file, parses configuration file into python dictionary, 
when printing the dictionary out, it removes/strips all (encrypted) passwords in configuration, 
it will be a little safer to share the new configuration file without password.
