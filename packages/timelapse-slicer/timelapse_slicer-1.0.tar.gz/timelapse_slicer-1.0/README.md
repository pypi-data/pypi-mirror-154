# One Click TimeSlice Tool

## What is this for

This is for photographers who want to create TimeSlice pictures without installing PS plugins.

## Before using this tool

Use Lightroom or other photo editing program to process the entire timelapse sequence and move all the colorgraded pictures (jpg) to one folder. LRTimepalse is recommended.

## How to use this tool

1. Change the original_dir and the number_of_slices to desired directory and number.

2. Run the program.

3. The program will create two folders inside the original directory. One is Processed and the other is Final. All the slices will be saved in the Processed directory. The final image will be stored in the Final directory.

4. Sit down and ENJOY!
