"""
Subpackage ``psfsub`` contains a large number of stellar PSF modelling +
subtraction algorithms. The following methods have been implemented:
- *median ADI/SDI* (Marois et al. 2006).
- *frame differencing*.
- a simplified version of *LOCI* (Lafreniere et al. 2007)
- different flavours of *PCA* (Soummer et al. 2012 and Amara et al. 2012)
working in full-frame, incremental and annular mode, including improvements,
speed tricks, compatibility with ADI/RDI/SDI datasets and datasets too large to
fit in memory.
- full-frame and annular versions of *NMF*.
